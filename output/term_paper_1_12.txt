Abstract

This study aims at investigating the causal relations between unemployment and
inflation in Cambodia according to the Phillips curve framework. Time series analysis
based on VEC model is employed to evaluate the causality among variables. The
observed variables are stationary at first difference using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test,
and one cointegrating equation is found from Johansen cointegration test. VECM model
is therefore appropriate for testing the long run relationship. The study finds that there is
two-way causality between unemployment and inflation in the short run while there is
one-way relationship from inflation to unemployment in the long run. However, the study
could not state whether there is a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in both
short and long run. Therefore, further study can be conducted to illustrate if tradeoff exists

and to examine the effect of these factors on Cambodian economy.
I. Introduction

Cambodia has shown strong economic growth over the last two decades after its
first national election in 1993. This country has recognized as one of the lower middle-
income economies with significant growth by the World Bank, and the government aims
to reach upper-middle income and high-income status by 2030 and 2050, respectively
(Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2016).

Along with this recent achievement, the government also pays attentions on
reducing the poverty, inflation as well as the unemployment rate to ensure sustainable
growth. Figure | explains the downward sloping trends of these economic determinants
from 1994 to 2015 which represents the efforts of the government to reduce these
development constraints. Inflation and unemployment in Cambodia plays a significant
role to reduce poverty and enhance economic growth. This study therefore will focus on
the relationships among them and try to explain this phenomenon.

From an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report (2017), inflation rate in Cambodia
will rise from 3.4 percent in 2017 to 3.5 percent in 2018. This scenario happens due to
the higher international price of oil and other goods. However, this level of inflation
remains favorably low. Inflation has been fluctuating over this period. Also, Cambodia
confronted high inflation rate at around 12 percent due to the existence of global financial

crisis in 2008.

1 Poverty is measured by the poverty gap index at $3.10 a day (2011 PPP). Some data on poverty gap are not
available (from 1995 to 2003, 2005, 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015).
Moreover, unemployment rate in the country is relatively low at 1.4 percent average
between 1994 and 2015. Cambodia has a high rate of labor participation in the economic
activities. However, it is informed in ADB report (2015) that young Cambodian workers
are poorly educated which leads to a mismatch between worker’s skills and employers’
demand. Over 4 out of 10 Cambodian workers do not have appropriate knowledge to
perform their jobs well. Thus, quality of education plays an important role to solve this
issue. Yet, accessibility to education for the poor and enhancement of teachers’ quality
need to be in place.

As seen in figure 1, the inflation in Cambodia keeps fluctuating over time while the
unemployment does not move that much. Hence, this study would investigate whether
there is any short-run or long-run relationship connecting inflation and unemployment
comparing to the Phillips curve framework where the tradeoff between them in the short-
run is present.

II. Literature Reviews

There are some previous studies on the relationship between the two economics
factors, namely unemployment and inflation. Those studies are summaries as follow.

Author Mankiw (2001) studied the short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff
based on the standard dynamic models of price adjustment. In this study, he raised that
monetary policy has short-run influence on unemployment and determines inflation in
the long run; he added that it can be explained why there is a short-run tradeoff through
price stickiness. Nevertheless, it is still unexplainable the dynamic relationships between
these two factors.

According to Staiger, D. et al. (1997), the author aims to observe the relationship
among non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), unemployment and
monetary policy. The study explained that the unemployment is not well estimated, so
change in NAIRU should be considered to explain the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Furthermore, the authors described the unemployment history could only explain
inflation in the next year, not the next two years. In this sense, there is no long-run effect
from unemployment to inflation.

Karanassou, M. et al. (2005) conducted a study on the effect of monetary policy on

inflation-unemployment tradeoff in the long run following frictional growth. The authors
found three empirical results. First, they argued that the long-run Phillips curve could be
flat. They stressed that, based on the result from OECD, inflation does not fall
unconditionally when unemployment is above its natural rate. It 1s obvious that
unemployment does not affect inflation rate in this case. Their second finding 1s that
money growth shock has a slow effect on inflation. Third, the effect of monetary shock
on unemployment is quicker. However, they added that the effect of monetary policy
takes time for us to see its real consequence.

There is another study conducted by the above authors, Karanassou, M. et al. (2008),
related to the impact of money supply on the long-run changes of inflation and
unemployment in the case of Spanish economy. They estimated the model for long-run
Phillips curve before and after the change of institution and policy separately. They then
found that effect of the decrease in money growth contributed larger to the rise of
unemployment before rather than after the policy change. The 10% decrease in money
growth forced the unemployment to rise by 5.3 percent before and 3.7 percent after the
change. However, they argued that this institutional change was not the reason behind
this differential effect. The restrictive monetary policy after policy change in post 1973
era could be the real cause. They further found that the money growth during 1990s led
to significant decrease of unemployment at the end of the decade. Their conclusion is
monetary policy helps directly promote macroeconomic activities and unemployment in
long run. Yet, the challenge occurs where it is no longer conspicuous that policymakers
should focus just on reducing inflation. Nevertheless, the main purpose for monetary
policy is to achieve both lower inflation and unemployment rates in the country. This
seems to demonstrate the effort of the government to reduce unemployment and inflation
should be balanced.

Il. Theoretical Frameworks

According to Mankiw (2013), the Phillips curve determines the tradeoff between
wage inflation and unemployment in short run. The policymakers are always focusing on
reducing both inflation and unemployment, but the results become mostly contradictory
which reflects the Phillips curve framework. However, the author emphasizes that today
Phillips curves has been redefined where wage inflation is replaced by price inflation,

expected inflation and supply shock are taken into account. He further explains the forces
on inflation rate which are expected inflation, cyclical unemployment and the supply
shocks as expressing in below short-run Phillips curve equation:
m=En—-B(u-u")+v
inflation = expected inflation — B X cyclical unemployment + supply shock
The minus sign before cyclical unemployment represents negative relationship
between unemployment and inflation. Unemployment (u) and inflation (7 ) are
endogenous variables which is influenced by supply shock (v) (Karanassou, M, ef al.,
2005). The coefficient £ 1s the slope of tradeoff between the two endogenous variables.
Figure 2: The Short-run Phillips Curve

Inflation, a

Unemployment, u

According to Mankiw 2013, he stated that “In the long run, the classical dichotomy
holds, unemployment returns to its natural rate, and there is no tradeoff between inflation
and unemployment” (p. 412). It implies that the cyclical unemployment become zero in
the long run, and it will not have an impact on inflation.

In addition to the long run scenario, even if the unemployment is at its natural rate,
the government policy to reduce inflation will affect the future unemployment. This can
be interpreted through sacrifice ratio which refers to the percentage of GDP sacrificed to
lower the inflation. Then, sacrificed ratio is linked with Orkun’s law to illustrate how long
it takes the unemployment to increase in order to reduce the certain rate of inflation

(Mankiw 2013).
IV. Data and Methodology
1. Data and Limitation

Due to the availability of data, this study will analyze the relationship between

unemployment and inflation in Cambodia using time series data from 1994 to 2015.
Annual data on unemployment and inflation are compiled from the World Bank data
(2016). Specifically, inflation is regarded as the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator
at annual rate while unemployment is measured as the total unemployment as percentage
of total labor force. STATA is used as a tool to analyze this case study.

2. Methodology

Before reaching the causality estimation of unemployment and inflation followed
VAR framework, this study will start with a simple linear model with unemployment and
inflation as dependent and independent variables, respectively.

UE, = Bot BiINF, + Ue, Ur~WN(0,07)

where UE; is the unemployment as percentage of total labor force at time t, INF;
is the inflation rate at time t, and wu; is assumed to be a white noise process to avoid
obtaining biased estimators.

Since this study is conducted using time series analysis, the stationarity of observed
variables first needs to be checked to avoid spurious regression. An estimation with non-
stationary data leads to inefficient estimators and produce invalid standard test results
(Granger and Newbold, 1974). Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is therefore employed to
perform the unit root check with null hypothesis stated that the series have unit roots. The
rejection decision 1s made depending on Mackinnon critical values at 1%, 5% and 10%
significance level.

Next step is to define the optimal lags for the estimation. This lag length selection
process plays an important role to avoid error estimation from choosing too many or few
lags. There are different criteria to help choose optimal lags such as Likelihood Ratio
(LR), Final Prediction Error (FPE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Hannan-Quinn
Information Criterion (HQIC) and Schwartz Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC).

The Johansen cointegration test is then employed to test whether or not there is a
stationary relationship among observed variables in long run. It consists of two tests
namely the maximum eigenvalue and trace test. Most importantly, this test will identify
the correct model (VAR model or VECM) for examining the causality between

unemployment and inflation.
Vv. Empirical Results
1. Unit Root Test

This test follows the simple autoregressive, AR(1), model as Y, = OY,_1 + €,
where €,~WN(0, 07). The two hypotheses are given as:

The null hypothesis HO: @ = 1 and alternative hypothesis H1: @ < 1

In performing the unit root test, the study has first tested the observed variables at
level and found that inflation is stationary while unemployment contains a unit root after
failing to reject the null hypothesis. It is necessary to perform another test at first
difference. The result then shows that both variables are stationary at first difference
considered as I(1) random walk process. Therefore, first difference variables will be used

in the estimated model. Table 1 shows the results from Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit

root test.

Note: ***, **, * represent significance level at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.
2. Lag length Selection
The study has performed a test for selecting optimal lags for the analysis. From
table 2, the optimal lag at 4 1s selected by LR, FPE, AIC and HQIC while lag 1 is chosen
by SBIC. This study will follow AIC result by choosing 3 optimal lags for each variable.

Note: * denotes the optimal lag selected by each criterion.
3. Couintegration test
The cointegration test is performed to check the cointegrating equations among stationary

variables. According to the results from Johansen cointegration test in table 3, trace statistic is
smaller than the 5% critical value which tells that the null hypothesis is failed to reject. Therefore,
there is at least a cointegration equation representing long-run relationship between observed
variables. When variables are cointegrated, vector error correlation model should be applied.

Note: * denotes the cointegration at each rank.
4. Granger Causality
This paper will adopt Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) with 3 optimal lags since

due to the results from lag length selection criterion and co-integration test. The VEC model can

be written as follows:

Pp Pp

AUE, =X, + ». X44 AUE,_; + » X12 AINF;,_; + 6,ECT,_, + eit (1)
t=1 t=1
p Pp

AINF, =XK5+ » X54 AUE,_; + » X52 AINF,_; + 62 ECT,_4 + E2t (2)
t=1 t=1

The result of VECE estimation is shown in Appendix 4.

From Table 4, there are both short-run and long-run relationships between
unemployment (DUE) and inflation (DINF) in the case of Cambodia. For short-run
relationship, there is a bidirectional causality between the observed variables. Inflation
has chi2 of 7.32 with p-value of 0.0257. The chi2 is statistically significant which
illustrates the short-run connection from inflation to unemployment. Similarly,
unemployment obtains the chi2 at 5.07 with p-value of 0.0793 which is marginally
significant and exhibits another causality relation from unemployment to inflation.

As long-run causality, there is only a unidirectional connection from inflation to
unemployment. The z-value of error correction term (ECT) from equation (1) 1s -2.44
which is negative and statistically significant at 5% level. This explains the long-run
connection from inflation to unemployment. However, the z-value of ECT from equation
(2) 1s 4.44 which is positive and statistically significant at 5% level. This positive z-value

does not represent the long-run causality.

[0.0793] [0.022]

Note: ***, **, * represent significance level at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

This implies that the framework of Phillips curse is applicable for Cambodia’s case
where there are causal impacts between inflation rate and unemployment in the economy.
To lower the unemployment rate, the government would use fiscal policy to increase the
aggregate demand through increasing government expenditure. The unemployment rate
will then fall by the increase in demand for labor. Labor wages will also rise while firms
start to raise the price of their products. The real wage will decrease and the workers will
negotiate for higher wage. Firms will then lose their profits which force them to reduce
their productivities and labor demands. This will lower price of goods, but raise the
unemployment rate.

However, unemployment does not affect the inflation in long-run perspective
because inflation 1s most likely influenced by the international price level of merchandises
rather than unemployment issue in Cambodia and unemployment is assumed to be at its
natural rate regarding the long-run theory.

It would be an advantage to emphasize that unemployment in Cambodia mainly
happens due to limited education attainment of Cambodian people, especially those who
live in rural areas. This is the reason that the government has recently tried to strengthen
the education sector as a major priority to promote high skilled labor and meet the
requirements of foreign investment firms. Furthermore, the effort to build good
cooperation regionally and globally plays an important role to expand its market and be
a conspicuous incentive for investors. Therefore, in the long run unemployment rate will
reach its natural level and only determine the progress on economy, not the inflation rate.

In additional, it is important to make sure that the residuals in estimation do not

contain serial autocorrelation. Lagrange-multiplier Test 1s used. From the probability of
chi2, the null hypothesis (HO: no autocorrelation at lag order) is failed to reject. Thus,
there is no serial correlation among variables.

Table 5: Lagrange-multiplier Test

chi2 df Prob > chi2
5.3347 4 0.25465
2.8480 4 0.58358

After employing VECM, the test for normally distributed disturbances after VEC
is needed to check whether all residuals are normally distributed to avoid having biased
estimators. Again, based on Jarque-Bera test, the null hypothesis (HO: Residual is
normally distributed) is failed to reject which implies that all residuals are normally
distributed.

VI. Conclusions

In conclusion, this paper aims to study the causality between unemployment and
inflation in Cambodia based on Phillips curve theory. Time series analysis on
unemployment rate and inflation 1s conducted, and VAR model is proposed to evaluate
the causality among variable. Before reaching the causality test, it is important to conduct
unit root test and cointegration tests to ensure the stationarity as well as to find whether
all variables are cointegrated. Both variables are reported as stationary at first difference,
and there is a cointegrating equation among them. This tells us that there is a long run
relationship among our estimated variables. Therefore, the study employs vector error
correlation model (VECM) instead of VAR model in order to check the long run causality.

From the regression results, the study finds that there is two-way causality between
unemployment and inflation in the short run. This implies that empirical result for short-
run connection corresponds to the short-run Phillips curve theory, where there exists the

relationship among the two factors, but it could not tell whether there is a tradeoff between
them. Aligned with previous research on the long run tradeoff, this study finds that there
is also one-way relationship from inflation to unemployment.

In efforts to reduce inflation through monetary policy in Cambodia, the government
should consider the long-term effect on its GDP and unemployment rate. Moreover, this
study also suggests that the government should pay more attention on promoting major
economic sectors including education sector which is the key to attract more foreign
investment and to stay competitive in international markets.

Further study on this framework can be conducted to illustrate the tradeoff between
unemployment and inflation, and to examine the effect of these factors on Cambodia’s

economy.
